# Cytron-Motor-Driver-Control
This Arduino code utilizes the CytronMotorDriver library to control two motors using a Cytron Motor Driver. The motors are controlled to perform a sequence of movements, including forward motion, stopping, turning, and reversing
//This code uses the CytronMotorDriver library. Make sure to include it in your Arduino IDE.
#include <CytronMotorDriver.h>
CytronMD motor1(PWM_PWM, 3, 9);   // PWM 1A = Pin 3, PWM 1B = Pin 9.
CytronMD motor2(PWM_PWM, 10, 11);
void setup() {

}
//Modify delays according to your motor specifications and movement requirements.
//Adjust the PWM pins in the CytronMD declarations based on your specific hardware setup.
//the following loops illustrates that the robot will move forward then stop for 2secs and then it turns anticlockwise

void loop() {
  motor1.setSpeed(120);   // Motor 1 runs forward
  motor2.setSpeed(130);  // Motor 2 runs forward
  delay(4000);

  motor1.setSpeed(0);     //stop
  motor2.setSpeed(0);
  delay(2000); 

  motor2.setSpeed(255); //turn
  delay(2000);

   motor2.setSpeed(63); 
  delay(4500);

 //below is the sequence of instructions which will move the robot in backward direction
  motor1.setSpeed(-70);   // Motor 1 runs backward.
  motor2.setSpeed(-180);  // Motor 2 runs backward.
  delay(3000); //turn 

}
